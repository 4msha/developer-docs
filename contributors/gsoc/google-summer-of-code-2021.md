## Project Ideas

### Voice Channels

* **Mentors**: [@pierre.lehnen](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/pierre.lehnen)
* **Description**: The ability to create voice channels would allow users to quickly enter and leave pre-existing voice calls from Rocket.Chat's own UI, enabling a more practical usage of audio features for team collaboration. This project would add the UI elements and integrate them with an established audio plataform to handle the calls.
* **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with nodeJS fullstack webapp development.

### Task Channels

* **Mentors**: [@pierre.lehnen](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/pierre.lehnen)
* **Description**: This project aims to create a new kind of channel where instead of sending messages, users would be able to create task cards with several custom fields. Those tasks would then work as a thread header, allowing comments in the format of a thread. The basic additional information for a task message would be an assigned user and a status. The channel header should also list options to filter the tasks by those fields.
* **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with nodeJS fullstack webapp development. Experience with ReacJS is ideal.
