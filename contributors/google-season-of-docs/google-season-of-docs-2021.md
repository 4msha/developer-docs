# Google Season of Docs 2021

[![Google Season of Docs 2019](https://github.com/Sing-Li/bbug/raw/master/images/gsodlogo.png)](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/)

[Season of Docs](https://g.co/seasonofdocs) is Google's annual program that fosters collaboration between open source projects and technical writers. 

Season of Docs is a unique program that pairs technical writers with open source mentors to introduce the technical writer to an open source community and provide guidance while the writer works on a real-world open source project. The technical writer ,in turn, provides documentation expertise to the open source organization.

Projects can cover a wide range of fields including Cloud computing, operating systems, graphics, medicine, programming languages, robotics, science, security and many more. Season of Docs is not a recruiting program or an internship but it does provide invaluable experience and looks great on a resume!
