# Google Season of Docs 2021

[![Google Season of Docs 2019](https://github.com/Sing-Li/bbug/raw/master/images/gsodlogo.png)](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/)

[Season of Docs](https://g.co/seasonofdocs) is Google's annual program that fosters collaboration between open source projects and technical writers. 

Season of Docs is a unique program that pairs technical writers with open source mentors to introduce the technical writer to an open source community and provide guidance while the writer works on a real-world open source project. The technical writer ,in turn, provides documentation expertise to the open source organization.

Projects can cover a wide range of fields including Cloud computing, operating systems, graphics, medicine, programming languages, robotics, science, security and many more. Season of Docs is not a recruiting program or an internship but it does provide invaluable experience and looks great on a resume!

### Project Proposal  \(Work in Progress\)

### JS SDK documentation

* **Mentors**: @rodrigok, @ggazzo
* **Description**: The JS SDK is a library of code written in JS that offers an easier interface to communicate with a Rocket.Chat server providing APIs to be called from a JS code that executes commands on the server, like send a message, or retrieve data, like get the list of rooms, abstracting all the logic necessary to handle the communication with the server side. You will be working with Rocket.Chat backend and frontend leads to improve the documentation of all JS SDK methods, from the initial setup of how to get the library and install it to the list of methods, how to use them and the expected returned data. Current documentation is under the SDK repository README.
* **Related Material**: [JS SDK repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.js.SDK), [Mention in BOT's Docs](https://docs.rocket.chat/bots/bots-architecture/#rocketchat-js-sdk), [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rocket.chat/sdk), [Documentation](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.js.SDK/blob/master/README.md)
