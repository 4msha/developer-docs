# Data Processing Agreement

Are you a Rocket.Chat customer and looking for a GDPR-compliant **data processing agreement \(DPA\)**?

You can find one here:

[Link to Data Processing Agreement Signature Form](https://sign.zoho.com/signform?form_link=234b4d535f49562351d2cf518ebdad978d344a54b95dc2f9d8a382d79fbed65b2fadf2781f81e4ad81514ab4f39f2fdfdfda6c03fd5beb4bbf48465bf2595f98447acd8bfaacb7d3#)

It is **pre-signed** and only needs to be signed from your end for your compliance purposes. It contains EU standard contract clauses as a data transfer mechanism for data controllers subject to EU law.

The data processing addendum might also make sense for customers, that run a **self-managed instance** of Rocket.Chat, but **connect to Rocket.Chat services** such as the push notification gateway or the marketplace. For this, you generally need to **register your server.** In these cases, personal data is processed by us to provide you these services and you might be required by the applicable laws to have a DPA in place. Our DPA is flexible enough to cover for these cases as well.

_Info: The DPA is not valid for individual Rocket.Chat users. For them, only our privacy policy applies. It also does not cover processing of third-party apps from our marketplace \(beyond us providing the capability to consume such apps\) and in case of multiple DPAs being submitted, only the most recent version applies._
