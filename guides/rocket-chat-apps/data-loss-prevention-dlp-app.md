Through DLP features, admins can create a list of regular expressions to be monitored in Rocket.Chat and it can be applied to any conversation.  
Once a regular expression is detected, it appears blurred in the room where it was originally written. The original message then is forwarded to a predefined channel for auditing flow, where a moderator can approve or reject its content to be exhibited in the room. You can add as many moderators as you want.  
It’s also possible to select the rooms to apply the DLP app. If you have channels in your Rocket.Chat where it’s more likely to happen a leak of sensitive information, such as the finance team channel, for example, you can set the tool to run just in this specific channel.
