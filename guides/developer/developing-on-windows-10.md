# Developing on Windows 10

Microsoft finally released Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 \(WSL 2\) in June of 2020.   Before this time, development of large and complex NodeJS based servers/full-stack applications such as Rocket.Chat on Windows is close to impossible.

WSL 2 is a complete architectural overhaul of Linux on Windows, installing a full genuine Linux kernel \(built by Microsoft\) alongside the classic Windows kernel. The Linux kernel and Windows kernel can now share system resources, such as memory and CPU, at a granularity not previously possible.  It also includes major performance optimization on cross-subsystems file sharing, boot, and other developer-relevant areas.

You must be using Windows 10  Release 2004 or later release to take advantage of WSL 2, and to setup Rocket.Chat development.
