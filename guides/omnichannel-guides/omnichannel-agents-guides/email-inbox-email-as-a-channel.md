# Email Inbox \(Email as a Channel\)

Once an email is part of a channel, your contacts can send emails to it to start a conversation. It will appear inside Rocket.Chat just like any other omnichannel livechat conversation. When you reply to an email message that has been sent to you, it will appear just like any other email in your contactâ€™s inbox.

As soon as your contact sends an email to the registered email address, it will appear in the queue just like any other omnichannel conversation, as shown below:

 As soon as you take it, it will appear in **Chats in Progress** and, you can click **Reply via Email** to reply to it.
