# Omnichannel Guides

Rocket.Chat had minimal Livechat as a feature for a long time.

Recently the demand for production-grade Livechat has increased, so we did a complete rewrite of the package.

## Activation 

### Enable Livechat feature

To enable the Livechat feature on your Rocket.Chat instance:

1. Go to **Administration.**

Now the admin will have access to _**Omnichannel Panel Settings**_ **** through a new menu called `Omnichannel` at the top left corner dropdown menu, as shown below:
